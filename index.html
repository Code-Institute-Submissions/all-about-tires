            <h3>In the beginning</h3>
                <p>The first tires were made of solid rubber and appeared in the mid-1800s. Unfortunately, the solid rubber would not absorb shocks very well, resulting in a bumpy and unpleasant ride. 
                John Boyd Dunlop is credited by some with creating the first air-filled, or pneumatic, tires in 1888. However, pneumatic tires were actually invented in 1845 by a Scotsman named Robert William Thomson.

                <h3>They became better!</h3>
            <p>
                In 1946, Michelin came out with a steel-belted radial tire in Europe. These new tires were made using nylon, rayon, or polyester along with rubber that was reinforced with steel fabric. 
                These tires lasted longer, were easier to steer with, had less road resistance, and increased gas mileage. 
            </p>

            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>In the late 1960s, Goodyear decided to try and break into the market with a tire that added a fiberglass belt to the older, diagonal-cord tires, increasing their life by several thousands of miles. However, when the gasoline crisis hit in 1973, Americans started buying more and more imported cars, equipped with the newer steel fabric tires. 
                The demand for the new tires rose even higher when people found out that they increased fuel efficiency.
