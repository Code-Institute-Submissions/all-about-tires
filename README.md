## Goal with the site

The goal of this website is to give people a perspective on how long tires have been around, and how important it is to take care of them. Safety starts with the grip on the asphalt.
The site is aimed at anyone who drives a vehicle on the road, everything from motorcycles to trucks and from slow-moving vehicles to racing vehicles.

## Design choices
- ### Typography
  - The fonts I chosen are orbitron for headings and ubuntu for body text. I chose the design of the fonts to give the website a slightly more futuristic and easy to read look.
- ### Colour Scheme
  - I chose white, dark gray and red as the color combination. This is to get good contrasts and a little mystery throughout the website.

## Existing features
- Featured on all three pages are home, services and contact, where the navigation is identical for easy use and navigation.

## The landing page
- The landing page features a sporty car in the city to make the reader more convinced and drawn towards performance.

## History of the car tire
- A short history of how the tire came about and developed over the years.

## Tire compound
- Here is a simple explanation of how the construction of the tire affects wear and grip.

## The footer
- Here is three social media links and one google map link to the shop, for easy access to the location.

- The four links follow the footer through all three pages to make a pleasant experience for the user.

## Services

- The image should give the reader the impression that the mechanics have a passion for vehicles and are very thorough in their processes to make the car as safe as possible.

- This section provides the reader with information about what services the company provides as well as costs for renting the services.

## Contact page

- On the contact page there is a form where you fill in your name, email address and a box where you explain what you need help with and then press submit.

![Submit form](assets/images/submit-form.png)

- Below the contact form is a video. When you press play, you get to see two mechanics changing a tire on a fast car.

## Features left to implement

- The tire workshop also wants automatic booking on the website, where the customer gets a email where it says time and date for the tire change.

## Testing

- I have had six people test the functions on the website where all of them uses different types of cellphones, all of them gave the site good feedback. No bugs were found when the people carried out the tests.

- The site looks good through all screensizes.

## Validator

- ### HTML
