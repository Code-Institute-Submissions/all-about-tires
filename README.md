# All About Tires

## Goal with the site

The goal of this website is to give people a perspective on how long tires have been around, and how important it is to take care of them. Safety starts with the grip on the asphalt.
The site is aimed at anyone who drives a vehicle on the road, everything from motorcycles to trucks and from slow-moving vehicles to racing vehicles.

## Features left to implement

- The tire workshop also wants automatic booking on the website, where the customer gets a email where it says time and date for the tire change.

## Testing

- I have had six people test the functions on the website where all of them uses different types of cellphones, all of them gave the site good feedback. No bugs were found when the people carried out the tests.

- The site looks good through all screensizes.

## Validator

- ### HTML 
  - W3C validator gave no warning or errors.

- ### Lighthouse

## Unfixed Bugs
- #### Jigsaw validator warning
  - Imported templates are not reviewed when entering directly or when uploading files.
  (The warning is not going to be fixed due to the font family i want for the homepage.)

## Deployment
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
