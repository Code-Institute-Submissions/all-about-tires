# All About Tires

## Goal with the site

The goal of this website is to give people a perspective on how long tires have been around, and how important it is to take care of them. Safety starts with the grip on the asphalt.
The site is aimed at anyone who drives a vehicle on the road, everything from motorcycles to trucks and from slow-moving vehicles to racing vehicles.
